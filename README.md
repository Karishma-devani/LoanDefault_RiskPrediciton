# LoanDefault_RiskPrediciton
A machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of loan default using financial and behavioral features. This project explores data preprocessing, feature selection, SMOTE-based resampling, and model development using XGBoost and Logistic Regression. It also includes deployment of models via Flask API and Docker, along with integration on platforms like Render.

ðŸ§  Key Highlights:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering and Top-10 Feature Selection

SMOTE for Imbalanced Classification

Model Building: XGBoost and Logistic Regression

Flask API Development for Model Deployment

Dockerization & Cloud Deployment (Render)
